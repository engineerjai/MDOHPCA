# library_template
A structure that can be a starting point for developers who want to create projects that depend on OpenMDAO.

This is the simplest working repository. 

This sample repo is fully installable using:
`pip install -e .`

You can build the docs by changing into `your_project/docs` and typing:
`make clean; make all`

There is one test in the `package` dir that will run with `testflo`.

Use this working example to build your own repository!
